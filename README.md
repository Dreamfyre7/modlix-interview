# Modlix Interview

At Modlix, we’re redefining how software is built—empowering non-technical creators, business innovators, and experienced developers alike.  

Traditional development is complex, time-consuming, and often exclusive to coders. We believe technology should be accessible to everyone. That’s why Modlix is building an open-source no-code/low-code platform that enables users to create scalable SaaS applications with drag-and-drop simplicity, a powerful component marketplace, and the flexibility to extend functionality with code.  

And we’re taking it further—integrating AI and machine learning to revolutionize the way applications are built. Our LLM-powered engine will allow users to simply describe their app in natural language, and Modlix will generate the entire UI, workflows, and business logic automatically.  

Our vision goes beyond technology—it's about building a collaborative, inclusive community where people of all skill levels can create, learn, and grow together. If you believe in a future where anyone can build software, we’d love to have you on this journey.  

Our inclusive team of developers, coders, and rebels push all the limits to lose "im" and make everything possible. And you will be part of this team.
