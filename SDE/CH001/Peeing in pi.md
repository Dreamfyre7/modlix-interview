# Challenge: Peeking Inside Pi

## Problem Statement

You will be given a numeric string.

Your task is to determine whether this string appears in the first 1 million and 1 billion digits of Pi.

If found, return the starting index (0-based) where the sequence appears in Pi.

If not found, return -1.

## Resources

Feel free to use any other website to get the file:

- [First 1 Billion Digits of Pi](https://archive.org/details/Pi-1b-digit)
- [First 1 Million Digits of Pi](https://archive.org/details/pi-1-million-digits)

## Constraints

- The input string can be of any length but will always be a numeric sequence.
- You should not compute Pi dynamically. Instead, assume you have access to a precomputed file or API containing the first 1 million or 1 billion digits of Pi.

## Expected Output

For each query:
- Return the index if the sequence is found.
- Otherwise, return -1.

## Bonus Challenges (Optional)

1. Create a Pi generator to generate 1000, 10,000 digits of Pi.
2. Can you go up to 50,000 or maybe a million?
